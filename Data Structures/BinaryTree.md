# Binary Tree

## Definition
- A data structure where every node has at most two children (one right and one left).

## What to Know
- Designed for optimizing and searching.
- Degenerate tree is also known as an unbalanced tree which, if entirely one-sided, is essentially a linked list.
- Used to make binary search trees:
    - Binary tree that uses comparable keys to assign which direct a child is.
    - Left child has a key smaller than parent node.
    - Right child has a key greater than its parent node.
    - There can be no duplicate node.

## Time Complexity
- Indexing, Searching, Insertion - O(log n)
