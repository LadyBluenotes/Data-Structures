# Iterative Algorithm

## Definition
- Algorithm that is called repeatedly but for a finite number of times, each time being a single iteration.
- Often used to move incrementally through a data set.

## What to Know
- Will see as loops, while and until statements.
- Moving one at a time through a set.
- Often used to move through an array.

## Compared to Recursion
- Recursion is easier to implement and more expressive.
- Iteration uses less memory.
- Functional languages use recursion while imperative languages use iteration.
