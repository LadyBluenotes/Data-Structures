# Merge Sort

## Definition
- Divide and conquer algorithm.
- Recursively divides entire array by half into subsets until the subset is one, the base case.
- Once the base case is reached, results are returned and sorted ascending left to right.
- Recursive calls are returned and the sorts double in size until the entire array is sorted.

## What to Know
- This is one of the fundamental sorting algorithms.
- Know that it divides all data into as small as possible sets then compares them.

## Time Complexity
- Worst Case: O(n log n)
- Average Case: O(n log n)
- Best Case: O(n)

## Space Complexity
- Worst: O(1)
