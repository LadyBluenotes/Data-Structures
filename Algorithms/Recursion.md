# Recursion

## Definition
- An algorithm that calls itself.
- Recursive case - conditional statement that is used to trigger the recursion.
- Base case - conditional statement that is used to break recursion.

## What to Know
- Errors will show stack level too deep or stack overflow.
- If base case is never triggered due to it being faulty or problem being too large, you run out of alloted memory.
- Often used with depth first search.
